/*
 
Abstraction -> Data hiding is the process of protecting members of class from unintended changes whereas,

abstraction is hiding the implementation details and showing only important / useful parts to the user.

Properties of abstract class ->

1. An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.

2. It can have abstract and non abstract methods.

3. It can not be instantiated.

4. It can have constructors and static methods also.

5. It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the methods.
