Encapsulation -> Combining the data(properties of a class) and their methods in a single unit.
              -> That single unit we named as class.


Note -> Data hiding is possible using Encapsulation.
     -> Data hiding : That sensitive data which you don't want to be visible for the user. 
     -> Data hiding is implemented with the help of access modifiers.
     -> Data are the properties of a class.
     -> Methods are the functionality of the class or we can say the function of the class.
